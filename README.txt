#### License List

This repository contains full text of licenses, for
the use of license-related projects in the Open Knowledge
/Free and Open Software/Academic sharing worlds.

The repository is originated from SPDX license list,
using its data on identification with full licenses
text, but adapted for the needs of these projects.

The intention of this collection is to be useful,
wherever the original text is needed. (i.e. license
tools, license choosers and application help)

#### This branch

The 'okfn' branch contains the full text of licenses
documented by http://opendefinition.org/licenses.

#### Note

Open Definition documents licenses conformant
to the definition, *and* apart from it, it documents
a set of licenses that do NOT conform to all open
definition principles, however do conform to only some
of them, and are sometimes confused.

This branch contains both conformant and non-conformant
licenses, for storage and use purposes.

Please check out the site for a clear explanation of the
split and which is which or why.
