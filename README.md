#### License List

This the full text of free/open licenses.

The intention of this collection is to be useful,
wherever the original text is needed. (i.e. information,
free/open documentation, license tools, license choosers
and application help)

#### Master branch

Master branch contains the full text of free/open
licenses.

The repository originated from SPDX license list,
for convenience of identification, but it has nothing
else in common with their list, and it doesn't contain
non-free/open licenses.

Please file an issue or a patch if you consider that any
non-free/open license sneaked in.

##### The selection for this branch is based on:
* any domain of human knowledge: software, writing, design
(content), data and databases, hardware, and not limited to.
* conformance with the [Four Freedoms](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), and/or [Open
Source Definition](http://opensource.org/osd), and/or the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org).
* well known and used in at least one visible community, today
or in the past.

The initial immediate use for this branch is license projects
such as [License Database](https://licensedb.org).

Use it as you see fit.
